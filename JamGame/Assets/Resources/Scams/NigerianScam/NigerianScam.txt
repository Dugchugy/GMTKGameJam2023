1|!|Nigeria is currently ungergoing great political turmoil. My uncle is attempting to illegitimately take the throne. If I were to contact home, he would ensure I never return.|&|19

1|!|Oh no! You have fallen victim to the lies of my uncle! I will have to find help elsewhere. goodbye.|&|23
3|!|You do some research and find that theres a Nigerian embassy in Germany. you give them a call and ask them if they can confirm some of the things the caller said. They inform you that Nigeria is a republic and does not have any princes. They do have a major issue with scam callers pretending to be Nigerian princes and offer you a $500 check for reporting the callers number. although you didn't technically scam the scammer, you still got $500 out of it. Good job.|$|S|&|0
